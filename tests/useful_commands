NODE.JS - part3

create a new template for application: npm init

add to the scripts in package.json: "start": "node index.js",

// add whatever to the index.js that is in the root of dir

run the program (2 ways): node index.js OR npm start (this second one is defined in the scripts part and it is customary to do it like that, i.e. by executing such tasks as npm scripts)

intall express library: npm install express

update dependencies: npm update

if we start working on the project on another computer, install all up-to-date dependencies of the project defined in package.json with running this command in the project's root directory: npm install

install nodemon as development dependency: npm install --save-dev nodemon

start app with nodemon: nodemon index.js
however, it is better to add a npm script for this in package.json and then strat it like this: npm run dev

spot a missing Content-Type header by printing all of the request headers: console.log(request.headers)
