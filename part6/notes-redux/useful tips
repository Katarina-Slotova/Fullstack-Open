- when using redux and I move App component to its separate file from index.js,
it is necessary for the App component to still aceess the store
- to enable the access, use hooks-api from react-redux library:
1. install react-redux library: npm install react-redux
2. install library Redux Toolkit for easier usage of Redux: npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
3. install library Redux Thunk: npm install redux-thunk
	- if we are using toolkit's cnfigureStore, then no additional config for Thunk is necessary
	- Thunk allows implementing action creators which return a function instead of an object
	- allows for example implementations of asynchronous action creators, which first wait for the completion of a certain asynchronous operation and after that dispatch some action, which changes the store's state
