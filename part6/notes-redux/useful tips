- when using redux and I move App component to its separate file from index.js,
it is necessary for the App component to still aceess the store
- to enable the access, use hooks-api from react-redux library:
1. install react-redux library: npm install react-redux
2. install library Redux Toolkit for easier usage of Redux: npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
